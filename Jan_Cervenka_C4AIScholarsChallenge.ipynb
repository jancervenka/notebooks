        "* Part One of the challenge requires identifying bugs, and getting the code working. This is designed to test your ability to grapple with real world engineering challenges.\n",
        "* Part Two of the challenge tests your ability to generate code for a specified problem.\n",
        "* Part Three of the challenge is an opportunity for you to attempt an optional challenge question that extends the original problem set.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this takehome, you will be working on a problem involving singular value decomposition. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) exists for every rectangular matrix. The nice thing about SVD is that the original matrix can be expressed as the sum of outer products of left and singular vectors scaled by the corresponding singular values. Formally:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Let 𝛢 be a rectangular matrix of dimensions 𝑚𝘹𝑛, then the SVD of the matrix A is given by $ A = U𝛴V^T$ where $U$ is an orthogonal matrix of shape mxm containing the left singular vectors, $V$ is an orthogonal matrix of shape nxn containing the right singular vectors and $𝛴$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of $A$. This formulation of SVD can be re-expressed as \\begin{align} A = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} s_i. u_i v_i^T \\end{align} where $r = \\text{min}(m,n)$ represents the rank of the matrix, $s_i$ is the $i$th singular value and $u_i v_i^T$ is the outer product of the $i$th left and right singular vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- \\begin{align}\n",
        "A = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\text{min}(m,n)} s_i. u_i v_i^T\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "\\begin{align} -->\n",
        "\n",
        "> The singular values $𝛴$ are decreasing in order. So, each outer product is scaled by a smaller value as we compute each term in the sum above. This gives us an opportunity to approximate $A$ using only the sum of the first $k$ outer products where $k < \\text{min}(m,n)$ $-$ this effectively means that we are zero-ing out some of the singular values by assuming that the contribution to the sum is negligible. This is called low-rank approximation.\n",
