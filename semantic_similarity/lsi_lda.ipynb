The first time I used it the motor had this really high pitch whine to it, sounded like it was working way too hard to do it's job. By the second use, this sound had gotten so bad I was afraid it might actually catch on fire so I threw it away. Please, don't waste your money on this horrible product. I will be purchasing from the other company from now on.</td>\n",

The no lather cleansing is equivalent to skipping the shampoo and only using conditioner. Your hair does NOT feel clean after using it. Although the frizzies may be tamer and your hair does feel soft, on the second day after using it, your hair feels greasy. I can usually go two days without washing my hair with regular shampoo, but with Wen I can't stand my hair the second day. I DO NOT recommend wasting $30 on this product.</td>\n",

After spraying this on my curls and \"scrunching\" upwards, I noticed that it got \"sticky\". After it dries, it leaves my curls somewhat hard and a bit less bouncy, my guess it's because of what's in it. I would say that if you want a lavender spray, buy some natural lavender oil and combine that with some water in a spray bottle, as for this, it's not for me.</td>\n",

Since I can stand them up, they don't take nearly as much space and the bins.

What I need to do is figure out a way to store it in its flat (unrolled) mode.... perhaps strong magnets on the side of the refrigerator.</td>\n",

Also when I smiled, it seemed like I could feel this thick dry lipstick crack on my lips. At days end, it was very difficult to wash off. In all, this lipstick was just too overbearing.
